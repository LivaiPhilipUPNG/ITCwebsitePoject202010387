    <h2>The New Proposed Airport under construction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the new proposed airports in Papua New Guinea by <b>National Airport Corporation</b></p>
    <div class="pro"><b><u>Project scope and schedule</u></b></div>
    <p>The current domestic and international terminals have limited capacity to accommodate current and future demand. <a href="https://www.jica.go.jp/png/english/activities/activity20.html" target="_blank"><i>The NAC has undertaken the schematic designs</i></a> for the expansion of the international and domestic terminal facilities as well as the extension of the international apron. The NAC has also developed schematic designs for the VIP facilities within the international terminal facilities, in anticipation of the APEC summit in 2018. The NAC will provide bridging documents and wishes to engage a contractor to produce the construction drawings, act as engineer of record and architect of record, and to construct these various facilities. It is expected that these projects will be completed no later than August 2018, so that they are available for use in time for the APEC Leaders Summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The NAC anticipates awarding a contract to the successful contractor in September and expects contractor mobilization by mid-October 2016. The total project timeline is estimated to be 22 months.</p>
